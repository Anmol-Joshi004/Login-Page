This project is a web application that enables users to register and log in to access information about courses available for BTech CSE students at IIT Indore. Built using Python (DJANGO), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application provides a user-friendly interface for registration, where users enter their UserID, Mobile Number, and Password, which are securely stored in a MySQL database.

After registering, users can log in with their UserID and Password. Upon successful login, they are greeted with a welcome message and the IIT Indore logo, along with a list of available courses displayed in an easy-to-read format. This project serves as a practical tool for students to quickly access course information while learning about web development and database management.
